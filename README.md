# Soulful
Ever wished that you didn't have to resort to crappy old paper cards to enjoy the wholesome experience that [Cards Against Humanity](https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/#download) offers? Well, that's what Soulful aims to solve, by bringing the light and joy of those innocuous cards to your device. 

Major kudos to the CAH team for releasing the cards under [CC BY-NC-SA 2.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/2.0/) and thereby enabling this project. Please support them and [buy](https://store.cardsagainsthumanity.com/) a physical pack. 

:warning: Soulful is still in heavy development! At the moment, you can't even play the game.

### Installation

The eventual plan is to bring Soulful to you as both a Windows and Android app. I'm not allowed to release this on any app stores, so sorry to all you Apple fans. However, I may try and get it running on WebAssembly in the distant future, so don't give up hope.

That preamble aside, **you can't install Soulful yet**. Please however feel free to build it and contribute.

### Building and Contributing

You'll need the .NET Core 3.1 SDK to build Soulful. Any issues/pull requests will be gratefully received, however please respect my code styling conventions.
